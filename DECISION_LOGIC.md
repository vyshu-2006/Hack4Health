## üö® Emergency Red Flag System

The system prioritizes safety through immediate emergency detection:

### Critical Red Flags (Always ‚Üí EMERGENCY)

| Category | Keywords | Action |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Chest Pain** | chest pain, crushing chest pain, squeezing chest | Immediate 911/108 |
| **Breathing** | difficulty breathing, can't breathe, gasping for air | Immediate 911/108 |
| **Neurological** | sudden weakness, facial drooping, slurred speech, seizure | Immediate 911/108 |
| **Severe Bleeding** | severe bleeding, uncontrolled bleeding, won't stop bleeding | Immediate 911/108 |
| **Trauma** | head injury, severe injury, broken bone visible | Immediate 911/108 |
| **Allergic** | severe allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, swollen throat | Immediate 911/108 |
| **Pediatric** | infant fever >100.4¬∞F, baby not responding, child difficulty breathing | Immediate 911/108 |

### Emergency Response Protocol
```
1. Trigger visual emergency modal
2. Play audio alert (if supported)
3. Display emergency numbers prominently
4. Provide immediate action instructions
5. Log emergency case for review
```

## üìä Urgency Classification Matrix

The system uses a 4-level classification system:

### Level 1: EMERGENCY
- **Trigger**: Red flag detection OR high-risk combinations
- **Response Time**: Immediate (< 100ms)
- **Action**: Call emergency services immediately
- **Examples**: 
  - "Severe chest pain and difficulty breathing"
  - "Child has high fever and trouble breathing"

### Level 2: URGENT 
- **Trigger**: Severe symptoms requiring prompt attention
- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours
- **Action**: Contact doctor or urgent care
- **Keywords**: severe pain, high fever >101¬∞F, persistent symptoms
- **Examples**:
  - "Severe abdominal pain that started suddenly"
  - "High fever for more than 3 days"

### Level 3: OUTPATIENT
- **Trigger**: Moderate symptoms requiring evaluation
- **Response Time**: Within few days
- **Action**: Schedule appointment or telemedicine
- **Keywords**: mild fever, sore throat, persistent cough
- **Examples**:
  - "Fever for 3 days and sore throat"
  - "Persistent cough without fever"

### Level 4: SELF-CARE
- **Trigger**: Mild symptoms manageable at home
- **Response Time**: Monitor for 24-48 hours
- **Action**: Home remedies and monitoring
- **Keywords**: mild headache, slight fatigue, minor aches
- **Examples**:
  - "Mild headache and slight fatigue"
  - "Minor muscle ache from exercise"

## üîç Symptom Analysis Process

### 1. Natural Language Processing
```python
# Symptom extraction patterns
patterns = [
    r'(pain|ache|hurt|sore)',      # Pain indicators
    r'(fever|temperature|hot)',     # Fever indicators  
    r'(cough|coughing)',           # Respiratory
    r'(nausea|vomit)',             # Digestive
    r'(bleeding|blood)',           # Bleeding
    # ... more patterns
]
```

### 2. Keyword Matching Algorithm
```python
def assess_urgency(symptoms_text):
    # Step 1: Check emergency red flags (highest priority)
    if check_red_flags(symptoms_text):
        return UrgencyLevel.EMERGENCY
    
    # Step 2: Check urgent conditions
    if check_urgent_conditions(symptoms_text):
        return UrgencyLevel.URGENT
    
    # Step 3: Check outpatient conditions
    if check_outpatient_conditions(symptoms_text):
        return UrgencyLevel.OUTPATIENT
    
    # Step 4: Default to self-care
    return UrgencyLevel.SELF_CARE
```

### 3. Confidence Scoring
- **Emergency**: 0.9 (highest confidence for safety)
- **Urgent**: 0.8 (high confidence for prompt care)
- **Outpatient**: 0.7 (moderate confidence)
- **Self-care**: 0.6 (conservative approach)
- **Unknown**: 0.5 (defaults to outpatient for safety)

## üìã Detailed Symptom Mapping

### Emergency Conditions
```yaml
chest_pain:
  triggers: ["chest pain", "chest tightness", "crushing chest pain"]
  action: immediate_emergency
  confidence: 0.9

breathing_difficulty:
  triggers: ["difficulty breathing", "shortness of breath", "can't breathe"]
  action: immediate_emergency
  confidence: 0.9

stroke_symptoms:
  triggers: ["sudden weakness", "facial drooping", "slurred speech"]
  action: immediate_emergency
  confidence: 0.9
```

### Urgent Conditions
```yaml
severe_pain:
  triggers: ["severe abdominal pain", "intense pain", "unbearable pain"]
  action: urgent_care_24h
  confidence: 0.8

high_fever:
  triggers: ["high fever", "fever over 101", "fever for more than 3 days"]
  action: urgent_care_24h
  confidence: 0.8
```

### Outpatient Conditions
```yaml
mild_infection:
  triggers: ["sore throat", "mild fever", "runny nose", "ear pain"]
  action: schedule_appointment
  confidence: 0.7

digestive_issues:
  triggers: ["nausea", "mild stomach pain", "heartburn"]
  action: schedule_appointment
  confidence: 0.7
```

### Self-Care Conditions
```yaml
minor_symptoms:
  triggers: ["mild headache", "fatigue", "minor ache"]
  action: home_care
  confidence: 0.6
```

## ü©∫ Pediatric-Specific Logic

### Special Considerations for Children
- Lower fever thresholds (100.4¬∞F for infants)
- Heightened sensitivity to respiratory symptoms
- Dehydration indicators
- Behavioral changes as symptoms

### Age-Based Rules
```python
def assess_pediatric_urgency(age, symptoms):
    if age < 1:  # Infants
        if "fever" in symptoms and "100.4" in symptoms:
            return UrgencyLevel.EMERGENCY
    
    if age < 5:  # Toddlers
        if "difficulty breathing" in symptoms:
            return UrgencyLevel.EMERGENCY
    
    # Continue with regular assessment
    return assess_general_urgency(symptoms)
```

## üí° Recommendation Generation

### Dynamic Response System
Based on urgency level and detected conditions, the system generates:

1. **Primary Assessment**
   - Urgency classification
   - Condition description
   - Confidence level

2. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - Immediate actions to take
   - When to seek care
   - What to monitor

3. **Next Steps**
   - Specific care pathways
   - Contact information
   - Follow-up guidance

4. **Educational Resources**
   - Relevant health information
   - Self-care instructions
   - Warning signs to watch

### Example Response Structure
```json
{
  "urgency": "emergency",
  "condition": "Emergency condition detected",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "red_flags": ["chest pain", "difficulty breathing"],
  "recommendations": [
    "This may be a medical emergency",
    "Do not delay seeking immediate medical attention",
    "Do not drive yourself - call for emergency transport"
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "Call emergency services immediately (911/108)",
    "Go to the nearest emergency room",
    "Contact emergency contacts or family members"
  ]
}
```

## üîÑ Fallback Logic

### Safety-First Approach
- **Unknown symptoms**: Default to outpatient evaluation
- **Multiple concerning symptoms**: Escalate to urgent
- **User uncertainty**: Provide multiple options
- **Technical errors**: Recommend professional consultation

### Error Handling
```python
def safe_fallback_response():
    return {
        "urgency": "outpatient",
        "message": "I cannot fully assess your symptoms. Please consult a healthcare provider for proper evaluation.",
        "emergency_note": "If this is an emergency, call 911/108 immediately."
    }
```

## üìä Quality Assurance

### Validation Methods
1. **Expert Review**: Healthcare professionals validate logic
2. **Test Scenarios**: Comprehensive testing with known cases
3. **False Positive Analysis**: Monitor over-classification
4. **False Negative Prevention**: Ensure no missed emergencies

### Performance Monitoring
- **Accuracy Rate**: % of correct classifications
- **Emergency Detection**: 100% sensitivity required
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds target
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback integration

## üåç Localization Considerations

### Regional Adaptations
- **Emergency Numbers**: 911 (US), 108 (India), 999 (UK), 112 (EU)
- **Healthcare Systems**: Public vs private pathways
- **Cultural Factors**: Communication preferences
- **Language Support**: Multi-language symptom recognition

### Example Localization
```python
EMERGENCY_NUMBERS = {
    'US': '911',
    'IN': '108', 
    'UK': '999',
    'EU': '112'
}

def get_emergency_number(country_code):
    return EMERGENCY_NUMBERS.get(country_code, '911')
```

## üî¨ Continuous Improvement

### Machine Learning Integration (Future)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from successful assessments
- **Symptom Correlation**: Identify new symptom combinations
- **Outcome Tracking**: Monitor patient outcomes
- **Model Updates**: Regular algorithm refinement

### Data Collection Ethics
